# HaskellProjects
Some of my Haskell projects I have done in my first year as an undergraduate
The projects are from very easy to farely difficult. Only some of them use monads, eg. TicTacToe. 
TicTacToe is also the most complex non-exam project I ever wrote in Haskell.
The first code I wrote using this language was Calculus.hs followed by Crypto.hs, which I found very difficult at the time.
I wrote Crypto.hs on my second week using Haskell, the terminal, git and VS Code.
Haskell was the first language I studied at Imperial.
After Haskell, I have learned Java extensively and then C in my first year. 
During the summer break I spent a lot of time with Flutter, coding Hyuga.
