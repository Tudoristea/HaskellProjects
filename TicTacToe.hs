  I could use a varaible z that is equal to "drop (x * n + y) (take (x * n + y + 1) boardList) == [Empty]" to make the code
    more readable
  Found out later that i ca n use boardList !! (x * n + y) to extract the (x * n + y)th element
  Decided to stick to the more complicated version because it is easier to read for me since it is a 
    direct representation of how I computed the problem in my head
